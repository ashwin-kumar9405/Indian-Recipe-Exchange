# Indian Recipe Exchange: 4-Week MVP Plan

## Week 1: Project Setup & Core UI
- Define requirements and success metrics
- Scaffold Streamlit app with multilingual form UI
- Set up language selection, recipe input, and basic local storage (JSON/CSV)
- Initial README and requirements.txt
- Research open-source AI libraries for translation/ingredient suggestions

## Week 2: AI Integration & Multilingual Support
- Integrate Indic NLP/Transformers for translation and ingredient substitution
- Build language detection and transliteration utilities
- Add region/language tagging to recipe corpus
- Test multilingual input/output (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.)
- Begin corpus collection (save recipes with metadata)

## Week 3: Offline-First & Community Features
- Implement offline/low-bandwidth support (e.g., Streamlit caching, local storage)
- Add recipe browsing, upvoting, and saving
- UI/UX improvements for mobile and low-resource devices
- Collect feedback from early users

## Week 4: Deployment & Corpus Export
- Prepare app for Hugging Face Spaces deployment
- Add corpus export (CSV/JSON) for AI training
- Finalize documentation (README, usage, contribution guide)
- Test end-to-end workflow (input, AI, storage, export)
- Launch MVP and promote for community contributions

**Goal:** Deliver a robust, inclusive MVP that collects diverse Indian recipes, supports major languages, and enables AI-driven translation/ingredient suggestions, ready for open-source deployment and corpus sharing.
